# render-me
3D render engine working off of TGA files : input a polygonal wire mesh with vertex and triangle information, receive a 3D model as output. Planning to add raytracing support as well.
Trying to OpenGL from scratch, following lectures from [TinyRenderer repo](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer).
